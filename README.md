# Androi Protocol

My first plataformer game is now created! 

I started this project as my final project from university with the help of one friend and them i've decided to continue working on him till i get some nice gameplay and basic levels.


Still not completed, but i've learned  a lot with this project and helped me to understand more of unity and c#, also level desing, g, IA, animations, particles, post processing and SFX.
