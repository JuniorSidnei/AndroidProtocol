long time ago, humanity starts they search for new planets, living things, everything new.... 
they've build spaceships, space stations, space  clothes..but they couldn't buit a new body, a new organic body that can handle the space exploration...
"so if our space ships can handle this, we need a body of metal like they"
After that, the first android was born, half organic half metal. 
It was a success for humanity and the new age was starting, the age of the Androids.
Finally the Androids started to explore the universe and discovered what they really wanted. But they never realized that to achieve this, they paid a huge price, theyr humanity.
Now life almost have no meaning, everything is  uselless and replacable. That was the price, and that became so common, even left a planet full of Android jsut to die was like nothing...
all the droids left behind started to think "we did this to ourselfs long time ago, theres no hope anymore", with that in mind they became agressive creatures with no rules,
no consciousness, wild beasts of metal.
Those planets became a huge place of war, whrere u hide and die peacifully or fight for your live and die with pain. This is your life now...Android.
