1 - Long time ago, humanity started they search for new planets, living things, everything new....

2 - They've build spaceships, space stations, space clothes..but they couldn't buit a new body, a new organic body that could handle the space exploration ...
"so if our space ships can handle this, we need a body of metal too!"
After that, the first android was born, half organic half metal.
It was a success for humanity and the new age was starting, the Age of the Androids.


3 - Finally the Androids started to explore the universe and discovered what they really wanted.
But they never realized that to achieve this, they paid a huge price, their humanity.
Their brains became brain-chips, but with the need of periodic maintenance to update new log, and dates.
This wast the big mistake, when a android couldn't updated his brain-chip, what happens to him?
They slowly became understoodable, aggressive, angry, with no consciousness ...

4 - So they had no other option unless leave thosse with no updates behind and begin a new life in another planet.
Now life almost have no meaning, everything is uselless and replacable. That was the price, and that became so common, that even left a planet full of Android jsut to die was like nothing ...
Wild beasts of metal, they was the only thing living int the isolated and abandoned planet.
Those planets became a huge place of war, whrere you hide and die peacifully or fight for your live and die with pain. This is your life now ... Android.
