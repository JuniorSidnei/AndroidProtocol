  - Long time ago, humanity started they search for new planets, living things, everything
    new....
  - 'They''ve build spaceships, space stations, space clothes..but they couldn''t
    buit a new body, a new organic body that could handle the space exploration ...

    "so
    if our space ships can handle this, we need a body of metal too!"

    After
    that, the first android was born, half organic half metal.

    It was a success
    for humanity and the new age was starting, the Age of the Androids.'
  - 'Finally the Androids started to explore the universe and discovered what they
    really wanted.

    But they never realized that to achieve this, they paid
    a huge price, their humanity.

    Their brains became brain-chips, but with
    the need of periodic maintenance to update new log, and dates.

    This wast
    the big mistake, when a android couldn''t updated his brain-chip, what happens
    to him?

    They slowly became understoodable, aggressive, angry, with no consciousness...

'
  - 'So they had no other option unless leave thosse with no updates behind and begin
    a new life in another planet.

    Now life almost have no meaning, everything
    is uselless and replacable. That was the price, and that became so common, that
    even left a planet full of Android jsut to die was like nothing ...

    Wild
    beasts of metal, they was the only thing living int the isolated and abandoned
    planet.

    Those planets became a huge place of war, whrere you hide and die
    peacifully or fight for your live and die with pain. This is your life now ...
    Android.'
